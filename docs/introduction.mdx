## Welcome to TUI-Kit-AI

TUI-Kit-AI revolutionizes how developers build terminal-based AI applications by providing a comprehensive, modular component library specifically designed for AI-powered CLI tools and agents.

## What is TUI-Kit-AI?

TUI-Kit-AI is a **TypeScript-first terminal UI library** that combines the power of modern terminal interfaces with seamless AI integration. Built on top of the proven Blessed.js foundation, it offers:

## Core Philosophy

### ðŸŽ¯ AI-First Design
Unlike generic TUI libraries, TUI-Kit-AI is built specifically for AI applications. Every component considers AI workflows, streaming responses, and real-time interactions.

### ðŸ§© Modular Architecture
The monorepo structure allows you to install only the packages you need:
- `@tui-kit-ai/core` - Essential TUI components
- `@tui-kit-ai/ai` - AI integration and streaming
- `@tui-kit-ai/agents` - Agent system and management
- `@tui-kit-ai/providers` - AI provider implementations
- `@tui-kit-ai/cli` - CLI framework and bootstrapping

### ðŸ’¡ Developer Experience
TypeScript-first design with comprehensive type definitions, intelligent autocomplete, and clear error messages make development smooth and productive.
